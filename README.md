# kinesis-client - 
- Uses aws kinesis stream api to publish and consume kinesis data. It should be used to test real time stream data in your kinesis pipeline. Assumes that a kinesis stream exists in your aws env. If the stream does not exist in your env/region, a 400 - stream not found error is shown. 
- This tool uses stream api, not the KCL - thus no checkpointing is done and the stream will available for re consumption by your KCL application. 

### Installation steps if you are new to GoLang !
